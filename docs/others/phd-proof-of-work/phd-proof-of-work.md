#### Abstract

The article examines the work of a converter that synthesizes sinusoidal voltage supply to the active-inductive load through method of controlled high-frequency pulses with sinusoidal pulse-width modulation.
High frequency semiconductor key elements of the converter switched at zero current, i.e. with reduced switching losses, each high-frequency pulse transmitted to the load range specified quantity / dose / energy.
The linear dependence on active power in load to the first harmonic amplitude of load voltage and regulation angle respectively is achieved.
Simulations on the operation of the converter to achieve a sinusoidal voltage in the converter output are carried out.

| ![Conclusion](./assets/publication-01-fig-02.png "Conclusion") |

As a result of the analysis and simulations, obtained through the program package MATLAB 7.1 is proven the capabilities of the inverter for the synthesis of sinusoidal output voltage.
Obtaining of an ideal sinusoidal voltage leads to a significant reduction of harmonics in the load of the converter. This ensures low level of electromagnetic interference and improves electromagnetic compatibility.
Switching semiconductor elements of high-frequency inverter is performed at zero current, by using high-frequency current impulses, controlled by SPWM signal.
The energy supplied from the high-frequency inverter in the process of synthesizing of the sinusoidal output voltage is dosed. By this dosing, the power losses in the power controllers, divided transformer and filtering inductance are minimal.
The analysis and simulations allows determining the parameters of the sinusoidal mode in blocks of control and filter-load.
