## Getting started

My main motivation to try Home Assistant was to use that nice looking 3D floor plan as well as ESPHome.

The initial idea was to use HA inside of a docker container, but figurate out that is not a great option, so dedicated a whole Raspberry Pi for it.

To prepare a SD Card with the OS just follow the [Installation](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi) guide.

## Addons

Installed the following Addons

- VS CODE
- samba share
