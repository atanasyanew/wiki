## Description

Using Raspberry Pi Zero W and Pimoron's Enviro+ hat for indoor monitoring station.

The station push data to the ``MQTT broker`` where is consumed by the ``Node-Red`` which take care for writing the data to the ``InfluxDb``.
Metrics are visualized with the help of the ``Grafana`` dashboards.

Files and parts:

- STL files for the station - [thing:3818372](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3818372)
- [Enviro+ hat for Raspberry Pi â€“ Enviro + Air Quality](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro?variant=31155658457171)
- Raspberry Pi Zero W with microSD card

Run the application on start-up (examples from the pimoroni's guide)

```bash
sudo contab -e
# Add the following in order to execute the script on start-up
@reboot python /home/pi/enviroplus-python/examples/all-in-one.py &

```
