# Raspberry Pi NAS server with OpenMediaVault and Plex

Initially had only one ``raspberry pi`` that act as a main server with a lot of containers (more than 10), it worked pretty decent, but I realized that would be better to separate some of the services used.

Having one for IoT, Home Automation, Monitoring, etc.. and another one for NAS and Media services.

As a result, the performance is more than enough for me, speed about ``100-120 MB/s`` upload/download.

For now OpenMediaVault and Plex fit my needs as a services, but in future considering add some of the mentioned at [Additional futures](#additional-futures-optional) section.

## Preparing the Pi

1. The OS
   - Download [Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/) and burn the image, you may use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) or something else of your choice.
   - Place an empty file named ``ssh`` in the boot partition before you eject the card.
2. Connect and run the ``RPI``, should also wire Ethernet cable.
3. Configurations
   - ssh using the default password ``raspberry``
     ```bash
     ssh pi@rasppberry.local
     ```
   - Change the ``Password`` and ``Hostname``, located in ``1 System Options``, consider using ``omv`` as hostname :)
     ```bash
     sudo raspi-config
     ```
   - Update and reboot
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade
     sudo reboot
     ```
  4. Disable swap and log2ram <br>
     - Disable swap 
       ```bash
       curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/atanasyanew/017e0d73005de50c82dab31806a4bb98/raw/disable-swap.sh -O
       sudo bash ./disable-swap.sh uninstallswap
       ``` 
     - log2ram <br> 
     You will need a git for installing log2ram
     ```bash
     sudo apt install git
     curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/atanasyanew/017e0d73005de50c82dab31806a4bb98/raw/log2ram.sh -O
     sudo bash ./log2ram.sh
     sudo reboot
     ```

## Installing OpenMediaVault

>This script will install openmediavault, omv-extras, and flashmemory

You may check and verify the content of this script at the following repository [OpenMediaVault-Plugin-Developers/installScript](https://github.com/OpenMediaVault-Plugin-Developers/installScript).

```bash
sudo wget -O - https://github.com/OpenMediaVault-Plugin-Developers/installScript/raw/master/install | sudo bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo reboot
```

Web UI accessible at port 80, [omv.local](http://omv.local/) with the default credential ``admin:openmediavault``

A few things more to be done are:
- Changing the default credential - ``System``/``General settings``
- Setup Date & Time - ``System``
- Storage initialize - ``Storage``/``Disks``, consider wipe the disk
- Creating a file system - ``Storage``/``File Systems``, using the default ``ext4``
- Creating a Users and Shares from ``Access Rights Management``
- Enable SMB/CIFS from ``Services``, then map the folders from the sub tab ``Shares``
- Using the shares from rest of the devices within ``WORKGROUP`` - you should be able to visit the NAS as device in Network section 

## Docker, Portainer and Plex

Docker and portainer can be enabled from the interface, look for ``OMV-Extras`` menu, sub tab - docker.
Portainer web UI serves at port [:9000](http://omv.local:9000)

Installing the Plex done from the portainer UI, using the compose file and the environment variables, provided from the GitHub Gist

1. Download the files from the gist - [atanasyanew/docker-compose.omvstack.yml](https://gist.github.com/atanasyanew/e444150ded1683a093b01683ea71cdc0)
2. Change the environment variables
   - ``PUID`` and ``PGID`` can be evaluated using ``id`` command in terminal
     ```bash
     id
     uid=1000(pi) gid=100(users) groups=100(users),1000(pi)...
     ```
   - Change volume paths
     ```yaml
     volumes:
      - /srv/dev-disk-by-uuid-af5a8eb6-0258-4501-b933-57d646cf7f70/Media:/media-content
     ```
3. Using the Portainer UI, go to ``Stacks``, ``Add stack`` button, ``Upload from your computer`` tab and then upload the compose file and env file.
4. Configure Plex from the UI, [:32400/web](http://omv.local:32400/web/)

## Remote development (optional)

Found it very useful to edit files on the ``RPI``

My main motivation was when I had to edit OpenMediaVault ``config.xml``.

VS code has extension so called [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh).

Using of the extension is straight forward, ``ctr + shift + p`` and type/choose ``Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...``, then follow the guide.

## Issues and troubleshooting

The problems I faced.

- **Creating a file system too much time.**
  
  I was having to trouble creating a file system from ``Storage/File Systems`` (using a brand new HDD), it was take hours of time and then crashes.
  The solution - I forgot to ``apt update`` and ``apt upgrade`` after installing the OMV.
<br>

- **Cannot SSH after reboot**
  Tick ``Permit root login`` on, located in ``Services/SSH``. 
  In my case it was on, but still should be turned ``of`` and ``on`` with the apply changes to take effect.
<br>

- **Unable to use remote development**  
  Tick ``TCP Forwarding`` on, located in Services/SSH.
<br>

- **Cannot delete shared folder**
  In order to delete the shared folder from ``Access Rights Management/Shared Folders``, the folder should not be referenced, you may check If so under the sub tab ``Shared Folder In Use`` or for some of the services such as ``Services/SMB`` the sub tab ``Shares``.
  
  In my case it was not, but still cannot delete a specific folder, the reboot and unassign permissions didn't help.
  
  The solution is to deal with the ``config.xml``, VS Code remote development used to edit the xml file.
  ```bash
  cd /etc/openmediavault
  cp config.xml config.bk
  ```
  Find and delete the section for the folder, the structure look like this:
  ```xml 
  <sharedfolder>
    <uuid>9e633982-8aeb-4d00-95e4-bc19fd6965fb</uuid>
    <name>FolderName</name>
  </sharedfolder>
  ```

## TODO

- [ ] Monitoring
  - Should install and create a telegraf configuration to collect server stats and send metrics to the main server
  - Attach metrics to Grafana dashboard
